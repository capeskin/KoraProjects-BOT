# discord-tickets
Open-Source, lightweight Discord ticket bot

## Setup:
### Installing RethinkDB
Follow the steps for your system at https://rethinkdb.com/install/

### Configuring/Running the bot
1. Rename the `src/config.example.json` file to `src/config.json`
2. Open the file in your favourite text editor.
3. The values are fairly self-explanitory, fill them in as needed.
4. Save the file
5. Run `node src/index.js`

### Extra
Be sure to `proxy_pass` the port to whatever url you desire. Also, ensure the url in the config file doesn't end in `/`
## If people want anything added, make an issue and I may come back to it but for now this project is dead.
### License
I don't really care what you do as long as you maintain the text in the help command. I reserve the right to edit the code at any time as well as take any and all action I see fit against anybody using my code to abuse either Discord or the users of a server.
